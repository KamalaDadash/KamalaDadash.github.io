I am a fourth-year applied mathematics Ph.D. student in the [Mathematics department](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University. Before joining the Ph.D. program at NCSU, I earned my master's degree in general mathematics at Western Kentucky University and my bachelor's in mathematics education at Baku Engineering University. My research focuses on enhancing predictive capabilities for pharmaceutical modeling via sensitivity analysis, parameter subset selection, and virtual population approaches. Apart from my professional skills, I enjoy swimming, hiking, and exploring different cuisines in my free time.

My research interest includes different aspects of applied mathematics, such as Uncertainty Quantification, Bayesian statistics, Mathematical and Statistical Modeling, and Machine Learning.
