Research Experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant, NCSU
  * Developed a sensitivity-based parameter subset selection (PSS) algorithms to determine identifiable parameter subsets for 
    mPBPK model of the brain with 31 parameters and 16 dependent variables.
  * Implemented the algorithms for the mPBPK model and validated outcomes using both qualitative and quantitative techniques in 
    MATLAB  to evaluate and compare accuracy.
  * Integrated PSS results with Bayesian inference to compute more accurate parameter estimates while significantly improving 
    computational efficiency.
  * Prepared weekly reports for a research meeting
  * Attended conferences to present obtained results

* Quantitative Systems Pharmacology(QSP) Intern, Pfizer
  * Worked on developing a QSP model of VZV vaccine immunogenicity to match published Shingrix clinical data
  * Collaborated with other modelers and clinical pharmacologists
  * Attended and presented weekly results in the subgroup and group meetings
  * Presented the talk about the obtained results for the project at the end of the internship
